 ## Introduction
 Howdy, INSERT USER HERE! WELCOME TO THE TUTORIAL! Today's tutorial, We are going to learn about x3d! Which is a markup language same like HTML.
 ### 
 First you gotta make a html page, maybe 3d.html,put ```<x3d>```for it to work And in the `<head>` put ```<script type='text/javascript src='http://www.x3dom.org/download/x3dom.js> </script> <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='http://www.x3dom.org/download/x3dom.css'></link>``` so that it will generate.
 ### Basic Tags!
 Some tags are:
 ## TAGS!
1. `<shape>`
2. `<appearance>`
3. `<transform>`
## Shape tag
The shape tag is to make the shapes. Some shape tags are:
1. `<box>`
2. `<cone>`
3. `<sphere>`
## Appearance tag
The appearance tag is for adding color in x3dom. Its like the `<style>` tag.
And I hear that you said "Why do we need it?", The reason is 
So that the shapes won't be just white because thats the standerd of x3dom.
And Also if you want to add color, you have to put ```<material diffuseColor='0 1 0'></material>``` and that code puts a red shape.
REMINDER: It uses RGB.
## Transform
The transform tag is for moving shapes! And we also have to learn about X3dom's coordinate system. It has the y-Axis pointing upwards. The x-Axis is extending from the origin to the right (east), and the z-Axis is facing towards the viewer (south). 
For example:  
``` 
<transform translation='-3 0 0'> 
    <shape> 
        <appearance> 
        <material diffuseColor='0 1 0'></material> 
        </appearance> 
        <cone></cone> 
    </shape> 
```
## Example
	```		
    <shape> 
        <appearance> 
        <material diffuseColor='1 0 0'></material> 
        </appearance> 
        <box></box> 
    </shape> 
    <transform translation='-3 0 0'> 
    <shape> 
        <appearance> 
        <material diffuseColor='0 1 0'></material> 
        </appearance> 
        <cone></cone> 
    </shape> 
    </transform> 
    <transform translation='3 0 0'> 
    <shape> 
        <appearance> 
        <material diffuseColor='0 0 1'></material> 
        </appearance> 
        <sphere></sphere> 
    </shape> 
    </transform> 
    ```
