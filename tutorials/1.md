## Creating a Simple HTML Page

Howdy, fellow WebMaster!
In today's tutorial, you'll learn some of the most basic HTML concepts there are, to make a website for your best (imaginary) friend, your cactus Jeff!
So, without further ado, let's get started. 

### Step 1: Create a New HTML File

First, create a new file with the `.html` extension on your local machine. You can use any text editor(such as Notepad++, Micro, VSCode...) to write code in it.
For demonstration purposes, let's name this file `index.html`. Even though you can name it whatever you want, it needs to be called `index.html` for it to serve as your PoyoWeb's index page.

### Step 2: Add the Basic Structure

Every HTML document needs a basic structure. Here is an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Now let's explain what it actually means:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type (in this case, an HTML document).
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element of an HTML page, with a language attribute set to English. Everything from any website is a descendant of this tag.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata(data about data, such as the website title, language, charset, etc etc...) about the HTML document.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the webpage is responsive(adapts to different screen sizes) and sets the width of the viewport to the device's width.
- `<title>My First HTML Page</title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document that is visible to the user. Another tags such as `<head>` have HTML but thats not shown to the user.
- `<h1>Welcome to My First HTML Page</h1>`: Defines a heading. `<h1>` is the biggest heading, while `<h6>` is the smallest one.
- `<p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

### Step 3: Add Content

You can add various elements to your HTML page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Here are some examples:

- **Headings**: Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags for headings.
- **Paragraphs**: Use `<p>` tags for paragraphs.
- **Images**: Use `<img>` tags to add images. Remember to add the `src` atttribute including the path to your image.
- **Links**: Use `<a>` tags to add links. Remember to add the `href` atttribute including the path to your image.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Cactus' Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my cactus' website!</h1>
    <p>I love cactus! Their hugs are so warm!</p>
    <a href="https://poyoweb.org">Visit The PoyoWeb!</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Conclusion

You have now created a simple HTML page. You can open this file in a web browser to see how it looks. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).
