## Creating a Simple HTML Page

Howdy, fellow WebMaster!
In today's tutorial, you'll learn some of the most basic HTML concepts there are to make a website for your best (imaginary) friend, your cactus Jeff!
So, without further ado, let's get started.

### Step 1: Create a New HTML File

First, create a new file with the `.html` extension on your local machine. You can use any text editor(such as Notepad++, Micro, VSCode...) to write code in it.
For demonstration purposes, let's name this file `index.html`. Even though you can name it whatever you want, it needs to be called `index.html` for it to serve as your PoyoWeb's index page.

### Step 2: The Basic Structure

Before starting at all, I want you to imagine HTML as a russian matrioska doll. There's dolls(tags) inside dolls inside dolls. When there's a first doll inside a second doll, the first one is called a **children** *tag*, and the second is the **parent** *tag*. Lemme show it to you more visually:

```html
<parent-tag>
	<children1></children1>
	<children1></children1>
	<children1>
		<children2></children2>
	</children1>
</parent-tag>
``` 
Tags are opened with `<tagname>` and closed with `</tagname>`, but beware! Some tags dont need to be closed. Some of them are `<img>` (displays an image) `<br>` (break rule, just like the `enter` key on your keyboard), `<hr>` (horizontal rule, displays an horizontal line across the entire width of its parent container)

Got it? Great! Let's move on onto our next subject, kinds of tags! 
Some *basic* tags are:
 
- The `<html>` tag, which contains the body and the head of an HTML document.
- The `<h1>` tag, which displays a heading(there's six levels of paragraphs, ordered from bigger to smaller. They are `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`).
- The `<p>` tag, which displays a paragraph. That's pretty much it, just a bunch of text.
- The `<a>` tag, which displays a link to another page or another site.
- The `<button>` tag, which displays a clickable button. You can put `<a>` tags around them to make them redirect to another pages or websites!
- The `<img>` tag, which displays an image or gif.

These tags can have attributes that (for instance) point a link to a page, an image to its source, and assign an action to a button.
Some widespread attributes are:

- `src`, the source of X resource. Obligatory in `<img>` and `<audio>` tags.
- `href`, the destination of X. Obligatory in `<a>` tags.

You can build a pretty much functional website with only this knowledge!
For instance, an HTML snippet for creating a heading with a subtitle would be:

```html
<div class="center">
	<h1 id="red-text">My cactus Jeff rocks!</h1>
	<p>He's so dope!!!</p>
</div>
```

Wait, did you see that?
Classes and IDs! Don't worry, they're just used for JavaScript scripts and CSS. We'll talk about it in another tutorial.
So, atm just focus on experimenting around and 

However, you still gotta follow a basic boilerplate. Here it is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{ title goes here }</title>
</head>
<body>
	{ content goes here }
</body>
</html>
```

Now let's explain what it actually means:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type (in this case, an HTML document). Every HTML document must have this declaration because it's what tells a browser that the file is indeed a page.
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element of an HTML page, with a language attribute set to English. Everything(`<body>`, `<head>`...) from any website is a <strong>descendant</strong> of this tag. 
- `<head>`: Contains metadata(data about data, such as the website title, language, charset, etc etc...) about the HTML document.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the webpage is responsive(adapts to different screen sizes) and sets the width of the viewport to the device's width.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document that is visible to the user. Another tags such as `<head>` have HTML but thats not shown to the user.

Keep in mind HTML is like a Matrioska. There's tags inside of tags inside of tags, and so on.
That's why you can't close a parent tag without closing all of the children tags.

### Step 3: Add Content

You can add various elements to your HTML page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Here are some examples:

- **Headings**: Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags for headings.
- **Paragraphs**: Use `<p>` tags for paragraphs.
- **Images**: Use `<img>` tags to add images. Remember to add the `src` atttribute including the path to your image.
- **Links**: Use `<a>` tags to add links. Remember to add the `href` atttribute including the path to your image.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Cactus' Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my cactus' website!</h1>
    <p>I love cactus! Their hugs are so warm!</p>
    <a href="https://poyoweb.org">Visit The PoyoWeb!</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Conclusion

You have now created a simple HTML page for your cactus Jeff! You can open this file in a web browser to see how it looks. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).
