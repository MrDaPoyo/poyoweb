<p><b>What's the PoyoWeb?</b></p>
<p>The PoyoWeb is a free, open-source web host made by a groupt of teenagers(<a href="https://poyo.study">Poyo</a> and <a href="https://sundown.poyo.study">Team Sundown</a>) who weren't happy with the absurd pricing of other webhosts. The poyoweb will(it's very WIP) also have many, MANY perks. Some of them will be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Free custom domains</li>
	<li>500 megabytes of storage</li>
	<li>Cute interactive Dashboard</li>
	<li>Clouds</li>
	<li>A fully integrated web editor for your files</li>
	<li>SSH access to your files</li>
	<li>A super duper cool API for you to use GitHub Actions with</li>
	<li>AI Scrapers and Crawlers are blocked from the entire PoyoWeb, including YOUR site! That means your assets will be safe and round!</li>
</ul>
